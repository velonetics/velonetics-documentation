All the documentation uses Markdown syntax and the site is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). After your contribution this repository will be used to compile all the documentation.

If you want to use a server to browse this pages, although not necessary, you can copy the folder inside the `content` directory in any Hugo installation.

# Contribute!
Feel free to fork this repository and contribute to a better Pucora documentation.

If you'd like to add a new language please open an issue before doing the work as we will need to add the support before it is visible.

Thanks for improving the docs!

# Helpers when writing
Besides from the regular Markdown to write content, there are a few shortcodes to help you style the documentation:

**Add a yellow note**:

For important notes, and things that need special, attention:

    {{< note title="A note on JWT generation" >}}
    Some big yellow block with a note
    {{< /note >}}

**Show terminal output**:

The CSS will prepend a dollar sign `$` in the first line.

    {{< terminal title="Title of the box">}}
    docker build -t mypucora .

    {{< /terminal >}}

**Highlight some code**:

Most of the code is just idented with a tab and Markdown renders it properly as a `<pre>` tag and we prefer not to colorize it much. Nevertheless this can be done with the following shortcode:

    {{< highlight json >}}
    { "a": true }
    {{< /highlight >}}

You can also highlight a line, specific lines `6 7`, or a range `6-8`:

    {{< highlight go "hl_lines=6-7" >}}
    package pucora

    import (
        "github.com/pucora/pucora-ce/logging"
        client "github.com/pucora/pucora-ce/transport/http/client/plugin"
        server "github.com/pucora/pucora-ce/transport/http/server/plugin"
    )
    {{< /highlight >}}

The documentation of the attributes is autoloaded from its json schema definition. You will find lines like the following:

    {{< schema data="folder/file.json" >}}

The `data` attribute loads the file from the [`pucora-schema` repository](https://github.com/pucora/pucora-schema), using the same path.
